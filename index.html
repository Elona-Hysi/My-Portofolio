    <p>Aspiring Front-End Developer</p>

  <section class="about-me" id="about-me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a junior web developer with a passion for design and creating meaningful digital experiences.
      After completing a six-month intensive coding bootcamp, I discovered how much I enjoy building clean,
      responsive interfaces—especially when I can combine logic with creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I don’t come from a traditional design background, I’ve always had a creative side—I love working
      with color, composition, and I even paint in my free time. That artistic perspective has shaped how I
      approach front-end development, with a strong focus on user experience and visual harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m especially excited by the idea that something I build can be useful to someone in the real world.
      I'm looking for an internship where I can contribute to real projects, learn from experienced developers,
      and grow within a company that values its people as true assets.
